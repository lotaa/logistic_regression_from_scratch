# Logistic Regression From Scratch


## Problem Statement
 
 Suppose that you are the administrator of a university department and you want to determine each applicant’s chance of admission based on their results on two exams.

* You have historical data from previous applicants that you can use as a training set for logistic regression.
* For each training example, you have the applicant’s scores on two exams and the admissions decision.
* Your task is to build a classification model that estimates an applicant’s probability of admission based on the scores from those two exams.

## Tool used

1.  numpy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
2.  matplotlib is a famous library to plot graphs in Python.
3.  utils.py contains helper functions for this assignment. You do not need to modify code in this file.
